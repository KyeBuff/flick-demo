# Flick React App
<p style="color: red"><strong>FOR BASIC DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES</strong></p>

Check it out <a href="http://kyebuffery.co.uk/flick-demo">here</a>.

The idea behind Flick is that users can tell us which apps they currently use to watch movies and TV series and we return a random collection of titles available on those apps and within the boundaries of their preferences. 

Flick will initially be launched as a native app, I am currently reviewing the work of another developer who is building this in React Native.

## Cypress TDD

Despite this being just a simple demonstration, I wanted to build the app using TDD. Having been introduced to Cypress recently, I was keen to start using it in my development workflow. I've since completed <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/examples/examples/tutorials.html">this</a> course and integrated some tests into this demonstration to help embed these new skills.

Through building my own tests in this demonstration, I have learned how to:

* Use Cypress' built in functions to create unit tests
* Use DOM queries to select elements and test their state
* Use functions like beforeEach and write custom commands to reduce repeated code in my tests
* Use stubs to simulate E2E testing and provide reliable, easy to test responses
